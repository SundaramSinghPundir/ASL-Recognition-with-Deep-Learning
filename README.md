# ASL-Recognition-with-Deep-Learning
American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. 
The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.
In this project, we will train a convolutional neural network to classify images of ASL letters. After loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, you will train the network and test its performance.
Project Tasks for this project are:
1. Understanding American Sign Language (ASL) dataset
2. Visualize the training data of the dataset
3. Examine the dataset
4. Defining the model for our dataset
6. Compiling the model
7. Training the model
8. Testing the model
9. Finally, Visualizing mistakes that are created during the project.
This project is made with help of instructors and trainers of DataCamp.
